# PythonLabs
Inside this repository you will find finished Python Labs for the FEEG 1001 module at the University of Southampton

(See http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~feeg1001/)

These include both Semester 1 weekly labs (found in the Semester 1 file) and the Jupyter notebooks from Semester 2 (found in the Semester 2 folder).

These labs are often unoptimized/messy but all required functions/code should work.
